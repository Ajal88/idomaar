This is a demo virtual machine that is used to demostrate the usage of Vagrant, Puppet, Spark and Notebook Python.

How to setup the local, virtualbox bases, environment:
1. starts the VM with "vagrant up" 
2. login into the machine with "vagrant ssh"
3. change to ipython user with "sudo su - ipython"
4. starts python notebook with "./start-ipython.sh"
5. open your browser (on your host machine) and go to http://localhost:8888
6. access to http://localhost:18080/ or http://localhost:18081/ to see the status of the local spark cluster while running a spark job


If you want to test the creation of the machine on amazon AWS use "vagrant up --provider=aws", before that be sure to configure the following environment variables:
'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID' - your amazon aws API access key ID
'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY' - your amazon aws API secret key
'AWS_KPAIR_NAME' - the name of the keypair you have created on EC2
'AWS_SSH_PRIVKEY' - the local filename of the pem file
